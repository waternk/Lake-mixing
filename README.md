# Characterizing vertical mixing in lakes and reservoirs

A parsimonious 1D turbulent diffusion model with an artificial circulation term to simulate both turbulent diffusion and artificial mixing.

## Purpose

Purpose of this software package is to characterize vertical mixing and assess the viability of artificial circulation in lakes and reservoirs.


## Folder structure

Source code of the turbulent diffusion model is stored in the file *TurbulentDiffusionModel.m*, and the example input data file is in *Inputdata.xlsx*.

## Prerequisites

TBD

## Example tutorial

### Model set-up

1. Parameter values listed under the *User defined parameters* are calibrated values for Jordan Lake study area. 
2. Make sure both source code and input file are stored in same folder.

### Running the model

The model is then run and will generate figures to visualize results (e.g., water temperature at various depths, turbulent diffusion at variopus depths, effective diffusion (including artificial circulation) at various depths).
